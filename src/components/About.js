                <h4>Crystal Coast Cuisine is geared towards providing both customers and restaurant managers with a <br/>centralized service for dining experiences on the Crystal Coast. The area is blessed with many <br/>privately owned establishments that customers may never hear of. Here, every <br/>restaurant is visible and separated by their respective town.</h4><br/>
                <h4>Another service provided is the ability for restaurants to post and update their daily specials <br/>which in turn, allows the customers to be more informed. Thanks for stopping by! Stay salty!</h4>
